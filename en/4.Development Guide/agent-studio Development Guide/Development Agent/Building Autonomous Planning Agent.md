The openJiuwen Agent platform provides users with rapid AI agent development capabilities, allowing users to quickly build fully functional agents without programming knowledge. In the openJiuwen platform, a complete agent typically consists of core components such as prompt configuration, model selection, skill components (such as plugins and workflows), and conversation experience settings. These components work together to give agents the ability to autonomously perceive, make decisions, and execute tasks. This article will use "AI Travel Guide Master" as an example to demonstrate the complete process of building an autonomous planning agent on the openJiuwen platform, including the following steps:

1. Create Agent
2. Configure LLM
3. Write System Prompt
4. Orchestrate Agent Functions
5. Debug Agent

## Operation Steps
### Configure LLM for Agent


In the agent **Orchestration Configuration** section, users can freely select an appropriate LLM model and configure options such as Temperature, Maximum Output Tokens, Top P, and Timeout.

![image](../images/5f20b900-55b5-4fb0-9bfb-3b4cb791364e.png)

The model configuration parameter descriptions are as follows:

| Parameter Name | Description | Configuration Instructions |
|---------|------|---------|
| Timeout | Maximum model response time | - Function: Control the model's response time to prevent the model from responding too long<br>- Note: Time unit is seconds<br>- Recommendation: Usually set to 30, can be adjusted according to needs |
| Temperature | Controls the randomness and creativity of model output | - Range: 0.0 - 2.0<br>- Low value (0.0-0.3): More deterministic, conservative, and predictable output, suitable for scenarios requiring precise answers (such as mathematical calculations, fact queries)<br>- Medium value (0.5-0.8): Balance creativity and accuracy, suitable for most conversation scenarios<br>- High value (0.9-2.0): More diverse, creative, and random output, suitable for creative writing, brainstorming, etc.<br>- Recommendation: When used with Top P, usually only adjust one of the parameters |
| Maximum Output Tokens | Limits the maximum number of tokens the model outputs in a single generation | - Function: Control the length of generated text to prevent output from being too long or consuming too many resources<br>- Note: 1 Chinese character usually occupies 2-3 tokens, 1 English word usually occupies 1-2 tokens<br>- Recommendation: Set according to actual needs, avoid setting too small which may cause output to be truncated |
| Top P (Nucleus Sampling) | Also known as Nucleus Sampling, selects the smallest set of words whose cumulative probability reaches p for sampling | - Range: 0.0 - 1.0<br>- Function: Dynamically adjust the number of candidate words to balance output diversity and quality<br>- Low value (0.1-0.3): Only consider the highest probability words, output is more focused and deterministic<br>- High value (0.8-1.0): Consider more candidate words, output is more diverse<br>- Recommendation: Usually set to 0.9-0.95, when used with Temperature, it is recommended to only adjust one of them |


# Configure Prompt (Optional)
Prompt configuration is a key link in agent function expansion, applicable to all developers creating agents on the openJiuwen platform. When agents need to have specific capabilities, follow specific rules, or provide professional services in specific fields, users can define the agent's role identity, behavior patterns, knowledge scope, and response style through prompt configuration to improve the agent's professionalism, practicality, and user experience. Users only need to write system prompts and make corresponding configurations to set clear identity positioning and behavioral guidelines for the agent.



### Configure System Prompt

Configuring system prompts is a core function for defining agent identity and behavioral guidelines, applicable to all users developing agents on the openJiuwen platform. When it is necessary to set role positioning, language style, and service boundaries for agents, users can ensure the consistency and accuracy of agent responses through system prompt configuration to improve user experience. Write and save prompts in the system prompt panel of the agent configuration page to complete the configuration.

#### Prerequisites
 - Agent has been created

#### Operation Steps
1. In the "System Prompt Configuration" window of the agent editing page, fill in the system prompt that needs to be configured
![image](../images/c86d49d3-f958-45b0-98af-97c85d610b8d.png)

# Orchestrate Agent Functions (Optional)

If the model's general capabilities can already cover the agent's core functions, then it is only necessary to define its behavioral logic through precise prompts; but if the agent's design goals exceed the model's own capability scope, it is necessary to add exclusive skills to expand the capability boundaries. For example, the core functions of "AI Travel Guide Master" (such as destination feature recommendations, food suggestions, etc.) can be achieved solely through the model's knowledge; but if you want it to provide real-time feedback on current weather at attractions, crowd density, temporary control notices at scenic spots, and other dynamic information—content that the model cannot obtain through inherent training data—you need to bind plugins such as "Weather Service Plugin" and "Map Plugin" to give the agent the ability to connect to real-time data sources and obtain specific knowledge, further improving the accuracy and practicality of services.

The functions currently included in agent orchestration are as follows:

| Skill Name | Description                                                      |
|------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Memory   | Refers to the agent's ability to store and call information such as user interaction history and task context, enabling the agent to maintain coherence and personalization during conversations or task execution |
| Workflow  | Refers to a series of operation steps or logic processes executed in sequence. Agents can achieve automated processing of complex tasks and multi-step collaboration through workflows        |
| Plugin   | Functional extension modules of agents. By integrating external services or specific capabilities, agents can access real-time data, perform specific operations, or obtain professional domain knowledge  |
| Knowledge   | Information sources for agents. By integrating knowledge bases, agents can access user-specified documents to provide more accurate and professional answers.        |
| Opening Statement  | Initial greeting or introduction information set for agent conversations, which can enrich the agent's usage scenarios and make the agent more friendly and personalized at the beginning of conversations    |



## Configure Memory
