# Prompt Optimization

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the prompt optimization feature, covering the complete workflow across four approaches: **Quick Optimization**, **Feedback Optimization**, **Optimization Based on Debug Results**, and **Self-Optimization**.

- **Quick Optimization**: Quickly performs global improvements and refinements on the entire prompt. Suitable for scenarios where you need to rapidly enhance the overall quality of a prompt.
- **Feedback Optimization**: Precisely optimizes a prompt locally or globally based on specific requirements. It supports three modes: Full-text Feedback Optimization, Selected-text Feedback Optimization, and Insert Feedback Optimization, to meet different optimization scenarios.
- **Optimization Based on Debug Results**: Optimizes the prompt based on AI responses from actual debugging conversations combined with human evaluation. Suitable for identifying real-world issues during usage and making targeted improvements.
- **Self-Optimization**: Automatically iterates and optimizes prompts using a dataset of test cases. The system compares actual outputs with expected outputs and continuously refines the prompt to reach a target accuracy, making it suitable for batch testing and continuous optimization.

## Optimization Based on Debug Results

The Optimization Based on Debug Results feature allows you to improve prompts by manually evaluating AI responses from actual debugging conversations. This feature is especially useful for identifying issues that arise during real usage and making targeted improvements.

### Steps

1. In the debugging area of the prompt editing page, locate the AI response that needs improvement. Click the **“Optimize Prompt”** button on the AI response to open the **“Optimize Prompt Based on Debug Results”** dialog. The dialog will display the corresponding user question and AI response.
2. In the **“Human Evaluation”** input box, describe in detail the issues with the AI response or the direction for improvement. For example: “The answer is too brief and lacks details”, “The user’s true intent was not understood”, or “The output format does not meet requirements”.
3. Click the **“Start Optimization”** button. The system will automatically optimize the prompt based on your evaluation and the conversation history.
4. After optimization is complete, the dialog will display the optimized prompt along with a before-and-after comparison.  
   - If you are satisfied, click **“Apply”** to replace the original prompt with the optimized version.  
   - If you are not satisfied, click **“Re-optimize”** to regenerate the optimized result based on the same evaluation, or modify the human evaluation and try again.

> **Tip**: The quality of the human evaluation directly affects the optimization outcome. It is recommended to provide specific and detailed feedback, including problem descriptions and expected improvement directions, so the system can better understand your needs and generate higher-quality optimization results.

## Test Case Set Management

The test case set is the core of an optimization task. It contains test cases used to evaluate prompt performance and guide prompt optimization. Each test case consists of inputs and an expected output (label).

A high-quality test case set should cover scenarios of varying difficulty levels, edge cases, and abnormal inputs to comprehensively evaluate prompt performance across real-world scenarios. By comparing actual outputs with expected outputs, the system can identify gaps and guide optimization directions to improve overall effectiveness.

### Test Case Format

Each test case uses JSON format and contains two main parts:

1. **inputs**: Input data containing one or more fields. Each field corresponds to a `{{variable}}` in the prompt.
   - If the original prompt contains `{{variable}}`, the field names in `inputs` must exactly match the variable names.
   - If the original prompt does not contain variables, `inputs` must contain only one field named `query`.
   - Field names must not exceed 50 characters.
2. **label**: The expected output, which must contain only one field. The field name must be either `output` or `tool_calls`.
   - `output` is used for normal text output, while `tool_calls` is used for tool invocation scenarios.
   - Field names must not exceed 50 characters.

### Adding Test Cases

#### Manual Entry

1. Click the **“Add Test Case”** button. A blank test case will appear in the list. Click the edit button next to the blank test case to open the edit page.
2. Fill in the message content on the edit page.
3. Click **“Save”**.

## Optimization Strategy

**Optimization Parameters**:

- **Number of Examples**: The number of examples used in each optimization round. A certain number of examples are selected according to a strategy and appended to the end of the prompt as sample guidance (default: min(total number of test cases, 20); range: 0 to min(total number of test cases, 20)).
- **Target Accuracy**: The accuracy target that the optimization task aims to reach. The task can terminate early once the target is achieved (default: 90%; range: 0–100%).
- **Maximum Optimization Rounds**: The maximum number of optimization rounds to prevent infinite optimization loops (default: 5 rounds; range: 1–20 rounds).

**Model Configuration**:

- **Optimization Model**: The model used to optimize the prompt and its parameters. It is recommended to choose a model with stronger capabilities.
- **Runtime Model**: The model and parameters used when the prompt actually runs. It is recommended to keep this consistent with real production scenarios.

## Evaluation Criteria

**Evaluation Types**:

- **Objective Evaluation**: Suitable for scenarios where outputs are quantifiable and have clear standard answers, such as data extraction, format conversion, and classification tasks. The system automatically scores results using methods such as exact matching and format validation.
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Suitable for scenarios where outputs are difficult to quantify and require holistic judgment, such as creative writing, sentiment analysis, and open-ended Q&A. The system uses evaluation models to score outputs based on dimensions such as quality, relevance, and fluency.

**Evaluation Rules**: A detailed description of evaluation rules and scoring standards used to guide the system in judging output quality. This should include specific scoring dimensions, weight distribution, and qualification criteria.  
For example: “Answer accuracy accounts for 60%, language fluency for 30%, and format compliance for 10%.”

**Background Knowledge**: Provide professional knowledge, contextual information, or domain-specific rules related to the task to help the optimization process better understand the business context and requirements. This may include industry terminology, business rules, and special constraints.
