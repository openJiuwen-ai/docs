# openjiuwen.dev_tools

`openjiuwen.dev_tools` provides openJiuwen's **Development Tools (DevTools)** module, targeting "development/debugging/iteration" scenarios, mainly covering two types of capabilities:
- **Prompt Building and Optimization (prompt_builder)**:
  - Used to convert "task descriptions/requirements/feedback/bad cases" into more robust prompt templates.
  - Suitable for quickly converging quality in prompt engineering phase, reducing manual repeated trial and error.
- **Agent Tuning (tune)**:
  - Used to combine `Optimizer + Evaluator + Trainer` into a repeatable training process.
  - Suitable for automated evaluation and iteration of prompt parameters (system/user prompt, etc.) when there is a case dataset.

> Note: `dev_tools` targets "development iteration", not recommended for uncontrolled calls in production main path (may bring additional LLM costs and time consumption).
>
> Production side usually uses solidified prompt/agent configurations, tuning process is recommended to run offline or in controlled environments.
